# TCP Client:

Countless times during penetration tests, we (the authors) have needed to whip up a TCP client to test for services send garbage data, fuzz, or perform any number of other tasks.

# TCP Server:

Creating TCP servers in Python is just as easy as creating a client. You might want to use your own TCP server when writing command shells or crafting a proxy.

Here I have created a standard multithreaded TCP Server.
